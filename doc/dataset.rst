Multiview Dataset MuPPI
=======================
In this multi-view dataset we describe the proteins of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The aim of building this multi-view dataset is to classify the extremely multifunctional1 (EMF) proteins from other proteins, and to identify their possible characteristics. The PPI network and the list of EMFs are taken from the work of Charles Chapple and Christine Brun [1], and are available from the MoonDB [2] database. The PPI network is generated by the MoonGO [1] pipeline gathering data from several different databases and filtering at the level of interaction identification methods to keep only interactions that can be considered as binary (i.e., likely direct). Self-interactions are discarded. This network is composed of 13683 proteins, and 90386 interactions.

Labels:

| "EMF_labels.txt" file.
| mono_clustered : 10129 examples
| multi_clustered : 3316 examples
| EMF : 238 examples

Proteins are classified into three categories: mono cluster, multi cluster and EMF. These classes are obtained through the MoonGO [1] pipeline on the PPI network mentioned above. This pipeline defines the protein clusters in the graph, based on their Biological Process annotations, from Gene Ontolgy. Thus, culsters group proteins with similar biological roles. Some proteins belong to only one cluster, they are called "mono_cluster". Others belong to several, they are called "multi_cluster". Among the multi-clusters, proteins that have a very rare pair of anntotation terms, in the Gene Ontolgy database, are classified as extremely multifunctional (EMF).

PPI network topology view:
--------------------------
| “PPInetwork_topology.txt” file, and “View0” in the hdf5 file. 
| (13679 examples, 10 features)

This view describes the topological properties of the PPI network for each node. It is obtained via the "node table" function on cytoscape. Explanations of the features : https://med.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/netanalyzer/help/2.7/index.html#closenessCent

- AverageShortestPathLength -float- : 
The length of the shortest path between two nodes n and m is L(n,m). The shortest path length distribution gives the number of node pairs (n,m) with L(n,m) = k for k = 1,2,…
The network diameter is the maximum length of shortest paths between two nodes. If a network is disconnected, its diameter is the maximum of all diameters of its connected components.
The network diameter and the shortest path length distribution may indicate small-world properties of the analyzed network.

- BetweennessCentrality -float- : 
The betweenness centrality Cb(n) of a node n is computed as follows:
Cb(n) = ∑s≠n≠t (σst (n) / σst),
where s and t are nodes in the network different from n, σst denotes the number of shortest paths from s to t, and σst (n) is the number of shortest paths from s to t that n lies on.
Betweenness centrality is computed only for networks that do not contain multiple edges. The betweenness value for each node n is normalized by dividing by the number of node pairs excluding n: (N-1)(N-2)/2, where N is the total number of nodes in the connected component that n belongs to. Thus, the betweenness centrality of each node is a number between 0 and 1. The betweenness centrality of a node reflects the amount of control that this node exerts over the interactions of other nodes in the network. This measure favors nodes that join communities (dense subnetworks), rather than nodes that lie inside a community.

- ClusteringCoefficient -float- : 
In undirected networks, the clustering coefficient Cn of a node n is defined as Cn = 2en/(kn(kn-1)), where kn is the number of neighbors of n and en is the number of connected pairs between all neighbors of n. The clustering coefficient is a ratio N / M, where N is the number of edges between the neighbors of n, and M is the maximum number of edges that could possibly exist between the neighbors of n. The clustering coefficient of a node is always a number between 0 and 1.

- ClosenessCentrality -float- : 
The closeness centrality Cc(n) of a node n is defined as the reciprocal of the average shortest path length and is computed as follows:
Cc(n) = 1 / avg( L(n,m) ),
where L(n,m) is the length of the shortest path between two nodes n and m. The closeness centrality of each node is a number between 0 and 1.
Closeness centrality is a measure of how fast information spreads from a given node to other reachable nodes in the network.

- Eccentricity -int- : 
The maximum non-infinite length of a shortest path between n and another node in the network. If n is an isolated node, the value of this attribute is zero.

- Stress -int- : 
This attribute counts the number of shortest paths passing through a node.

- Degree -int- : 
In undirected networks, the node degree of a node n is the number of edges linked to n. A self-loop of a node is counted like two edges for the node degree. The node degree distribution gives the number of nodes with degree k for k = 0, 1, …

- NeighborhoodConnectivity -float- : 
The connectivity of a node is the number of its neighbors. The neighborhood connectivity of a node n is defined as the average connectivity of all neighbors of n. The neighborhood connectivity distribution gives the average of the neighborhood connectivities of all nodes n with k neighbors for k = 0, 1, ...

- Radiality -float- : 
This attribute is a node centrality index computed by subtracting the average shortest path length of a node n from the diameter of the connected component plus 1. The radiality of each node is divided by the diameter of the connected component. Thus it is a number between 0 and 1.

- TopologicalCoefficient -float- : 
The topological coefficient Tn of a node n with kn neighbors is computed as follows:
Tn = avg ( J(n,m) ) / kn.
Here, J(n,m) is defined for all nodes m that share at least one neighbor with n. The value J(n,m) is the number of neighbors shared between the nodes n and m, plus one if there is a direct link between n and m. The topological coefficient is a relative measure for the extent to which a node shares neighbors with other nodes.

- This view describes 3 tables (one for each sub-graph GO: Cellular Component (CC), Biological Process (BP) and Molecular Function (MF)) with as index the PPI proteins, and as columns the GO Term of the sub-graph. For a given protein, a 1 indicates the protein is annotated for this GO Term or this GO Term is an ancestor of a protein annotated GO Term.. The other columns are filled with 0's. To define ancestors of a GO Term, the relationships taken into account are "is a", "part of" file, and "regulates". Perfectly identical columns are merged into one, as well as their column names. Thus three identical columns A, B, and C will be merged into one: A_B_C, containing the same information as the first three.

| The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human diseases. Each HPO term describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as blindness. The database is being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM. The data are organized in a table with the PPI proteins as an index and the columns correspond to the terms HPO. Let's say that the gene coding for a protein A is annotated with a term X, and that this term X has the terms Y and Z as parents and ancestors. Then the table cells in row A and the X, Y and Z columns will be 1's.The table cells with no match will be 0's. The perfectly identical columns are merged into one, along with their column names. So three identical columns A, B and C will be merged into one: A_B_C, containing the same information as the first three. 3416 PPI proteins are encoded by genes annotated by HPO, the remaining 10268 have 0's in each term.

This view uses the data produced by the work of Ribeiro D. et al [5]. It consists of a list of proteins complexes : 3'UTR where an RNA recruits an RBP (RNA Binding Protein), which in turn recruits an intermediate protein, which in turn binds to the nascent protein being translated, from the starting RNA. These complexes are predicted from networks of protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions. The dataset obtained has the PPI proteins as rows and the three types of proteins in the complexes (nascent, intermediate and RBP) as columns.

- Inter_linked -int-
When a protein is nascent in one or more complexes, number of different intermediates to which it binds.

- RBP_linked -int-

| This view collects information on short linear motifs, also known as eukaryotic linear motifs (SLiMs or ELMs), detected in protein sequences as defined by the ELM database [4]. They are predicted by the SLIMProb tool, with a threshold on the motifs mean disorder at 0,4. We keep only ELM classes that have a probability of occurrence under 0,001 in the human proteome, and that been experimentally verified in at least one human protein. Doing so, we have identified putative 163 different ELMs on 9879 PPI proteins.

Each amino acid (AA) of a protein have a disorder score, between 0 and 1. It is the probability of the AA to be in a disordered protein region, as opposed to the ordered regions that are protein domains. In those features, we have the average disorder score of each protein. There is two way to calculate it so we have one column for each disorder score.
