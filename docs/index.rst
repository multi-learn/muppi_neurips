Welcome to MuPPI Dataset documentation!
=======================================

**MuPPI Dataset**

In this multi-view dataset we describe the proteins
of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network.
The aim is to classify the extremely multifunctional* (EMF) proteins of others,
and to search for their possible characteristics.
The PPI network and the list of EMFs are taken
from the work of Charles Chapple and Christine Brun*,
and are available from the MoonDB** database.
The PPI network is created from several different databases,
with filtering at the level of interaction identification methods.
The MoonGO* software considers only direct,
binary and experimentally tested interactions.
Interactions of a protein with itself are suppressed.
This network is composed of 13683 proteins, and 90386 interactions.
